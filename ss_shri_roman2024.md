# IEEE RO-MAN 2024 Special Session on Social Human-Robot Interaction of Human-care Service Robots: <br/> *Exploring Foundation Models in Social Human-Robot Interaction*

- Session Code: 91r6n

## Aim and Scope

Service robots have transcended the introductory phase and are now widely deployed, playing a pivotal role in enhancing our daily lives. Marking the fourth installment of this influential special session at RO-MAN 2024, we continue our commitment to advancing the field of social human-robot interaction. This year, we are placing a special emphasis on the application of foundation models in social human-robot interactions, a rapidly evolving area that promises to revolutionize our understanding and implementation of socially intelligent robots. The special session aims to foster a pioneering exploration into how foundation models are reshaping the landscape of social interactions between humans and robots. Our discussion will encompass:

- Innovative Technical Implementations: Delving into how foundation models enhance the capabilities of social robots for more natural and effective human-robot interactions.

- Design, Functionality, and Behavior: Examining the impact of foundation models on the design and functionality of service robots, ensuring they are user-friendly and exhibit advanced social intelligence.

- Human Behavioral Insights and Expectations: Understanding the human side of the equation â€” how people perceive, interact with, and adapt to robots powered by foundation models.


In addition to these focus areas, we also warmly welcome papers addressing general issues in social human-robot interaction. This broadens our scope to include a wide range of topics and perspectives, enriching the discourse and development in the field.

We invite experts and enthusiasts from diverse fields, including human-robot interaction design, AI, social psychology, and robotics, to contribute to this dynamic discussion. This session will serve as a platform for sharing innovative ideas and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately contributing to the seamless integration of service robots into society.

Topics of interest include but not limited to:
- Adaptive Conversation Models for Human-Robot Interaction
- Foundation Models for Emotional Intelligence in Robots
- Cross-modal Understanding for Enhanced Social Interaction
